/**
 * Wraps a particular stream so that its subscription lifecycle
 * is automatically tracked by the provided Tracker.
 *
 * When the decorated stream is subscribed to:
 * - It is registered with the tracker (via Tracker.track).
 *
 * When the returned subscription is unsubscribed or the stream completes:
 * - The underlying stream subscription is unsubscribed.
 * - Tracker.complete is called, removing it from the tracker and completing
 * its status observable.
 *
 * This prevents the need for manual tracker management in consumer code.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The type of values emitted by the stream.
 *
 * @param stream - The Streamix Stream instance to decorate.
 * @param tracker - The Tracker instance used to monitor this stream's lifecycle.
 *
 * @returns The same stream instance, but with its `.subscribe()` method
 * overridden to include tracker lifecycle handling. The subscription
 * returned by `.subscribe()` will also handle cleanup automatically.
