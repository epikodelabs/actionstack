We have finally removed the old init(store) and destroy(clearState) methods from modules (yeah, those were kinda creepy 😅).</p><h2 id="_3-0-14" tabindex="-1">3.0.14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-14" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.14&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Callable thunks also respect selected strategy (not just plain actions anymore), added robust thunk triggering based on action type or predicate functions, optimized lock usage to minimize held time while preserving serialized state access, improved error handling with descriptive messages, and enhanced concurrent scheduling of thunks for better performance and reliability.</p><h2 id="_3-0-10" tabindex="-1">3.0.10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.10&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Removed <code>ExecutionStack</code>, due to previously eliminated epics and sagas middlewares. Continued emphasis on using only thunks and callable thunks for handling asynchronous logic and side effects, enhancing simplicity and predictability. Small fixes in <code>module</code> implementation.</p><h2 id="_3-0-9" tabindex="-1">3.0.9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-9" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.9&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Introduced <code>trackable()</code>, a stream decorator which adds trackability to applied stream. Made the tracker property publicly accessible on the Store type, enabling usage of <code>trackable()</code> and other tracker utilities outside the store context</p><h2 id="_3-0-8" tabindex="-1">3.0.8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-8" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.8&quot;">​</a></h2><p>ActionStack V3 replaces epics and sagas with callable thunks — simpler async handlers triggered directly or by actions. This reduces middleware complexity and boilerplate while improving type safety and modular side-effect management.</p><h2 id="_3-0-7" tabindex="-1">3.0.7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-7" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.7&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Removed MainModule type — no longer required by createStore. Added addReducer method to support dynamic reducer registration. module.init(store) and store.loadModule(module) are equivalents. Replaced middlewareAPI property with a getter to defer access and ensure correct store context.</p><h2 id="_3-0-6" tabindex="-1">3.0.6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-6" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.6&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Introduced populate() method to initialize and register multiple static modules at once. Useful for bootstrapping app-level modules in a single call. Corrected code samples in README.md</p><h2 id="_3-0-5" tabindex="-1">3.0.5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.5&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The documentation has been expanded with practical examples and usage samples to help developers get started quickly and understand the core concepts more clearly.

Actions will apply updates to nested state objects based on their full slice path (e.g., foo/bar/MY_ACTION targets state.foo.bar). All internal state management functions (getState, setProperty, dispatch, loadModule, etc.) now support both string and array paths transparently. Utility function normalizePath(path: string | string[]): string[] added to unify path handling.</p><h2 id="_3-0-1" tabindex="-1">3.0.1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0.1&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Redesigned core architecture to eliminate traditional reducer logic. Introduced fully modular &quot;slices&quot; using colocated state + actions (inspired by Zustand, but type-safe). Actions are now defined using the new action() utility that bundles. No more reducers in the usual sense — state updates are handled via registered action handlers. Type inference has been improved across actions, selectors, and middleware.</p><h2 id="_2-2-3" tabindex="-1">2.2.3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.2.3&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Improved typings for createAction to reflect the overloaded behavior, enabling stronger type safety and better autocompletion in editors.</p><h2 id="_2-2-1" tabindex="-1">2.2.1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.2.1&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Corrected the initialization logic of the store enhancer to ensure it receives the fully constructed store instance instead of new store creator. This ensures the enhancer accesses the store only after it’s fully initialized, preventing issues with repetitive or premature store initialization and supporting more predictable enhancer behavior.</p><h2 id="_2-2-0" tabindex="-1">2.2.0 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-0" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.2.0&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Support for Streamix <code>v2.0.1</code>.
